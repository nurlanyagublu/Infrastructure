# CI/CD Pipeline Test

This file tests our GitHub Actions workflows:

## Workflows to Test:
1. 🔒 Security Scan (triggered by this PR)
2. 🏗️ Terraform Plan (triggered by this PR if terraform files change)
3. 🚀 Terraform Apply (manual trigger)
4. 🐍 Backend Deploy (manual trigger)
5. 🎨 Frontend Deploy (manual trigger)

## Test Status:
- Created: Sat Jun 28 06:37:21 PM CEST 2025
- Branch: test-cicd-pipeline
- Purpose: Verify CI/CD workflows are working

## Expected Results:
- Security scan should run automatically
- Terraform plan should run if terraform files are modified
- Manual workflows should be available in Actions tab
